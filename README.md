## Preparing your environment

You can skip steps 1 and 2 if your development environment already has NodeJS 15 set up. Check the [`.tool-versions`](.tool-versions) file to know the specific NodeJS version this repo requires.

1. Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)
2. Add the NodeJS plugin to asdf with `asdf plugin add nodejs`   
3. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/ggalmazor-training/nodejs-trivia), clone it somewhere in your computer, and run `asdf install` and `npm install` where you cloned it.
4. Test your environment by running the tests with `npm run test`
